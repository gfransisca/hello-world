# hello-world

Hello fellow hoomans!

I am finally trying GitHub for the first time ever. Hoping that I can up my coding skills...if I had any to begin with. 

I would like to have some tacos on the moon some day. I bet their tacos will be out of this world! Hahaha, get it? I love puns!

Goodbye for now. 

From Earth, live long and prosper, my friends!
